This branch allows setting xtriggers for all tasks that
depend on the same xtrigger function signature.
  cylc set --pre=XTRIGGER/label

Not sure if that's what we want, or to set by label?

   xf = xfile(file="/tmp/a%(point)s", _=%(point)s)

Backing out for now, for group trigger development.
(to just set the target task's dependence on an xtrigger)
