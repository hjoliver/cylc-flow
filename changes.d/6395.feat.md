When triggering a group of tasks, flow history will be removed (by default) to
allow the group to rerun in the same flow, off-group prerequisites will be
satisfied automatically to prevent them from causing a stall, and in- group
prerequisites will be left to the flow. This allows (re)triggering a sub-graph
without manually handling flows, initial tasks, and off-flow prerequisites.
